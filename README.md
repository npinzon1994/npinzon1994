#### Updates! ⚡

*3/26/2023*
- Users can now edit expenses by clicking on them
- Pagination -- expenses are now organized into pages of 10 (if the list contains more than 10 items)
- Refined UI
#

#### Project Description
Budget Breakdown is a simple money management application. I started this project briefly in March 2022 but had to take some time off until I really buckled down and started getting it up and running. In its current state, it allows users to enter credit card expenses into a form which get output to a list on the main page. Users can also edit and delete expenses as well as filter them by paid/unpaid.  
  
I coded this app with React.js to really put my knowledge to the test after starting a React course on Udemy. Aside from all the unexpected errors this project has thrown at me, I had a lot of fun putting it together! I had a lot of "aha!" moments where the core concepts I was taught in the course finally clicked with me -- like managing state with ```useReducer()``` and ```useContext()```, or handling http requests with ```useEffect()```. Although there are still a lot more features I wish to implement, this project undoubtedly took my React skills to the next level.

<br />

#### Planned Features
- Ability to search for expenses by Merchant, Amount, or Date
- Support for multiple users (authentication)
- Multiple account types (i.e. debit, credit, savings, etc.)
- Equity vs. Expenses for a certain time frame -- either a window and/or graph with the information.
- More filter options
- ~~Ability to edit expense items~~ ✅
- ~~Implement a page system with a maximum of about 10 or 20 expenses per page~~ ✅
