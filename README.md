### Junior Software Engineer

<p>I'm an independent Front-End Web Developer looking to ease the lives of everyone around me through code. My passion for clean, component-driven design and problem solving are what drive me to create the best products possible. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have spent the past several months learning and honing my skills with React.js, while concurrently developing my own personal money management app. As I continue to build up my project portfolio, my goal is to begin my career in Web Development and start contributing to large-scale web applications in the real world.</p>

#### Updates! ‚ö° 

- Users can now edit expenses
- Expenses are now organized into pages of 10 (if the list contains more than 10 items)
- Refined UI
#

Budget Breakdown is a simple money management application. I started this project briefly in March 2022 but had to take some time off until I really buckled down and started getting it up and running. In its current state, it allows users to enter credit card expenses into a form which get output to a list on the main page. Users can also delete expenses as well as filter them by paid/unpaid.  
  
I coded this app with React.js to really put my knowledge to the test after starting a React course on Udemy. Aside from all the unexpected errors this project has thrown at me over the past few months, I had a lot of fun putting it together! I had a lot of "aha!" moments where the core concepts I was taught in the course finally clicked with me -- like managing state with ```useReducer()``` and ```useContext()```, or handling http requests with ```useEffect()```. Although there are still a lot more features I wish to implement, this project undoubtedly took my React skills to the next level.  
  
#### Planned Features
- Multiple account support (i.e. debit, credit, savings, etc.)
- More filter options
- ~~Ability to edit expense items~~ ‚úÖ
- ~~Implement a page system with a maximum of about 10 or 20 expenses per page~~ ‚úÖ
