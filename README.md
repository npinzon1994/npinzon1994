### Independent React.js Developer

<p>Hello! I'm an independent Front-End Web Developer looking to ease the lives of everyone around me through code. My passion for clean, component-driven design and problem solving are what drive me to create the best products possible. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have spent the past several months learning and honing my skills with React.js, while concurrently developing my own personal money management app. As I continue to build up my project portfolio, my goal is to begin my career in Web Development and start contributing to large-scale web applications in the real world.</p>
